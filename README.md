Some files are stored with Git Large File Storage. To download them, install git lfs (https://git-lfs.github.com/) and, in the cloned repository, run:

```bash
    $ git lfs pull
```

All packages needed to run the code are provided in the requirements file. Please install them in your environment with the command:

```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Feel free to send an email to atleeri@ifi.uio.no or atle.rimehaug@gmail.com for any questions or requests.

NB: The experimental MUA dataset is not downsampled and thus too large even for git lfs. You can access the raw ECP data to obtain the experimental MUA yourself at https://portal.brain-map.org/circuits-behavior/visual-coding-neuropixels, or you can reach out to the authors to arange a transfer of the MUA data.
